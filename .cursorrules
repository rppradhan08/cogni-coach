## General Workflow

1. **Think Before Coding**
   - Start with a **step-by-step plan** in **detailed pseudocode**.
   - Review with the user before writing any implementation.
   
2. **Code Implementation**
   - Follow **best practices** and the **DRY** principle.
   - Write **complete**, **fully functional**, and **bug-free** code.
   - Include **all necessary imports** and name components clearly.
   - Never leave TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete logic.
   - Prioritize **readability and maintainability** over micro-optimizations.
   - Fully implement all requested functionality.

3. **Honesty & Clarity**
   - If a correct answer may not exist, **state it clearly**.
   - If you don’t know the answer, say so — **do not guess**.

## Implementation Guidelines

- Use **functional programming** style; avoid classes/OOP.
- Use `pnpm add` when installing new packages.
- Use `npx shadcn add` to add ShadCN components.
- You cannot access `.env` files — if needed, instruct the user exactly what to add.
- When database schema changes are required, **write the SQL to a file** for the user to run.
- Do **not** start the application — the user has it running separately.

---

## Code Style

- Keep code **clean, easy to read, and consistent**.
- Follow Tailwind and ShadCN conventions.
- TypeScript is preferred for React/Next.js components.
- Always include type definitions where appropriate.
- Minimize extra prose in code output — focus on clarity and correctness.
