# CogniCoach MVP Feature Specification

Based on the identified pain points and the trends in AI-driven career tools, a simple, buildable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of this product should focus on the most critical and widely experienced challenges, leveraging AI primarily through text-based analysis for initial feasibility.
Here's a recommendation for a simple, buildable MVP:
Recommended MVP: AI-Powered Resume & Interview Feedback Assistant
This MVP focuses on directly addressing the significant pain points related to ATS unreadability, keyword relevance in resumes, and the lack of realistic mock interview practice with detailed feedback. It prioritises features that can be built using readily available AI capabilities like Natural Language Processing (NLP) without requiring complex real-time video or audio analysis in the first iteration.
1. Core Feature 1: AI-Powered Resume Optimiser
This module aims to make resumes ATS-friendly and highly relevant to job descriptions, tackling common design, content, and keyword issues.
• Resume Upload/Text Input: Users can easily upload their resume (e.g., .docx, .pdf, or paste text) into the platform. This caters to various user preferences and ensures the system can parse the content.
• Job Description Input: Users must input the job description for the role they are targeting. This is crucial for tailored AI analysis.
• ATS Readability & Formatting Check: The AI will analyse the resume for ATS compatibility, highlighting issues such as two-column layouts, non-standard fonts, or unreadable elements that prevent proper parsing. It will also check for consistent formatting, correct verb tenses, and general tidiness.
• Keyword Matching & Relevance Score: This feature will scan the job description for key terms and phrases, then compare them against the user's resume. It will provide a relevance score and suggest missing keywords or exact phrases that should be integrated to improve recruiter search visibility. It should also advise against keyword stuffing.
• Content Clarity & Impact Suggestions: The AI will identify vague or weak descriptions (e.g., "responsible for") and suggest more compelling, scannable language that highlights tangible contributions and value. It will guide users on avoiding irrelevant information or excessive technical skills.
• Basic Error Correction: Auto-detect and suggest corrections for typos and grammar mistakes.
• Actionable Feedback & Download: Provide a clear, consolidated report with actionable suggestions for improving the resume. Potentially offer an option to download a text-based, ATS-optimised version of the resume with the suggested changes implemented.
2. Core Feature 2: AI-Powered Text-Based Mock Interviewer
This module addresses the significant pain point of lacking realistic interview practice and personalised feedback. By focusing on text, it simplifies the initial build while still providing immense value.
• Customisable Interview Scenarios: Users can select from pre-defined sets of common behavioural and technical questions (e.g., "Tell me about yourself," "STAR method questions") or input a job description for more tailored questions.
• Text-Based Q&A Interface: The AI asks interview questions, and the user types their responses. This makes the initial implementation simpler than real-time audio/video analysis.
• Instant Text Feedback: After each answer (or at the end of a short session), the AI provides immediate, detailed text-based feedback:
    ◦ Content Relevance: Assess if the answer directly addresses the question asked.
    ◦ Conciseness & Clarity: Evaluate the length and clarity of the answer, suggesting ways to be more succinct or elaborate.
    ◦ Vocabulary & Tone: Provide suggestions for stronger vocabulary and appropriate professional tone.
    ◦ Filler Word Detection (simulated): Identify repetitive phrases or non-essential words that might mimic filler language in spoken responses.
    ◦ Keyword Integration Check: If a job description was provided, analyse if the user's answers incorporate relevant keywords.
• Automated Feedback Report: At the end of a mock interview session, generate a summary report of performance, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement, providing actionable insights.
3. Foundational Elements: Transparency & Trust
Even in an MVP, establishing trust and ethical guidelines is crucial.
• Explicit AI Disclosure: Clearly state upfront that AI is being used for resume analysis and mock interview feedback.
• Basic Data Privacy Statement: Inform users how their input (resume text, interview answers) will be handled, stored, and protected, aligning with general data protection principles.
• Feedback Mechanism: Allow users to provide feedback on the AI's suggestions and performance, aiding in future improvements and fostering a sense of user involvement.
By focusing on these core, buildable features, the MVP can quickly provide significant value to job seekers, addressing their most pressing challenges in a scalable and efficient manner, while setting the stage for future expansion into more advanced capabilities like video analysis or salary negotiation.
